   We made history.
      <br> <br>
I'm beyond excited to share the incredible journey we had at CodeDay Jamshedpur! Organizing the first-ever CodeDay in Jamshedpur wasn’t just about hosting a 
      technical event - it was about creating a space for ideas, for innovation, and for students to believe that they can.
<br><br>
As the Regional Manager, I had the privilege of leading a passionate team of six who worked relentlessly to make this 12-hour hackathon + workshop event a reality.
<br> <br>
Running a 12 hour long coding event in a city with very little exposure about hackathons and 
      such events was quite a challenging task. From sleepless nights to coordinating logistics to tackling last-minute chaos, we faced it all head-on – and it was worth every moment. 
With 70% turnout from registered participants, and even attendees traveling all the way from other cities, we witnessed firsthand how much hunger there is for opportunities like this.
<br> <br>
What made this even more special? <br>
Seeing participants leave with wide smiles, new friends, real projects, and telling us things like “This was the best day of my life.”<br> 
How do you even put that into words?
<br> <br>
A huge thank you to CodeDay, our amazing judges Himanshu Lohani, Sagar Singh and Udit Utsav, and my teammates - Aditya Raj Singh, Hanzala Seemak, Madhurima Bose, 
      Smriti Menon and Syed Owais- who kept showing up and showing out. Thank you to Prateek Deshmukh and Ojas Srivastava for being there behind-the-scenes on every step of the way.
<br> <br>
This isn’t just a milestone for Jamshedpur. It’s a spark. I can’t wait to see what we light up next.
