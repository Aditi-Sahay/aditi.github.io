     From abandoned verses to midnight recordings, this is the story of how my music video came to life...
      I remember very vividly typing to one of my friends how metaphoric it would be for a person to ignite a fire in someone. How it would imply 
      such passionate love. Nevertheless, a relationship like that would would sure be disastrous.
      
      I have been writing songs and recording my voice and figuring out mixing and composing since I laid my hands on my laptop for the first time.
      Last year, after a whirlwind of emotions I got down to writing (something I do after any emotional storm), coming up with the line "i was he fire, and you kerosene".
      Soon the idea of that snowballed into a whole song. I sat down one night and recorded the background instrumentals for it through my keyboard. 
      A month later, I finally found the courage to sing the lyrics for the song without weeping and sobbing. And with months of delay and mixing and mastering and re-mastering, 
      I finally had a demo to force my peers to listen to.
      And to my surprise, they loved it.

      From then, a month later, on 17th may 2024, I made my debut into the singing world with "kerosene".
      The track talks abt how two young adults who are holding onto each other while knowing they should let go bc they are in love. Both of them are 
      still growing and learning things and how their toxic traits ruins something "grandeur" they had, just like the combination of kerosene and fire burns everything up. 
      (might've been inspired from incidents of my personal life :) )
      Make sure to give it a listen sometime. Link in <a href="index.html">homepage.</a>
