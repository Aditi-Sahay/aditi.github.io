    Unsaid wasn’t just poetry—it was healing, raw rage, and the quiet comfort of being seen. 
      <br>
      Growing up expressive in multitude of ways from dancing to music to writing, poetry my way of expressing everything I felt.
      I grew up reading my mom's school's poetry book and poems I found on Pinterest. One of my favourites is "She walks in beauty" by Lord Byron and I will always yearn to be someone's muse that way.
      But till then, I gather muse from my daily life. Be it my friend's heartbreak, or a stranger's silence, or my own chaos. 
      <br> <br>
      It is almost surreal to think how this one doc file which has been sitting on my desktop for 4 years now is now finally in a book form. It is crazy to think how much efforts have been poured into the 
      making of Unsaid and the tears shed behind each emotion I personally felt. These words are not just poetry that is written by me; they are my raw emotions snatched right out of my gut and heart and printed onto 
      paper.
      <br><br>
      I am an author. <i> I </i> am an author. So crazy to even think about. My words have weight and they are on paper in a book that <i> I </i> wrote.
      Hope you all give it a read and enjoy the rollercoaster through the emotions!
